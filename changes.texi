interpreter.

The following instructions were added:

Instruction @code{unbind-all} was added to support tail-recursion
removal.  However this was never subsequently implemented; so this
intruction was never generated.

Starting in this version, unless C prepocessor variable
@code{BYTE_CODE_SAFE} (off by default) is defined, the obsolete
instructions listed in 18.59 are not implemented.

Bytecode meta-comments look like this:
